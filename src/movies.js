// Iteration 1: Ordering by year - Order by year, ascending (in growing order)

//Create a function orderByYear() that receives an array as parameter and returns a new sorted array.
//If two movies have the same year, order them in alphabetical order by their title! 

list = ["lion king", "jumanji", "husbandStopMakingNoise"];

function orderByYear(filmArr) {const whateverUwant = filmArr.sort((a,b) => a-b)
    return whateverUwant}

print = orderByYear(list)
console.log(print);


// Iteration 2: Steven Spielberg. The best? - How many drama movies did STEVEN SPIELBERG direct
//One of the most famous directors in cinema is Steven Spielberg, and he has some really awesome drama movies 
//that are on our list, but we want to know how many of them are there.
//Go ahead and create a howManyMovies() function that receives an array as a parameter and filter the array 
//so we can have only the drama movies where Steven Spielberg is the director.
